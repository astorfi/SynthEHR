Our goal:
---------

The goal of this research is to generate synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) using Improved Generative Adversarial Networks: Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) and Boundary-seeking GAN (BGAN ). We defined the two models as medWGAN and medBGAN respectively.

> The generated EHRs will be more realistic than the existing works (e.g. medGAN) and these data will be free of legal, security and privacy concerns
